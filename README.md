#sizle
sizle is a Photoshop scripted application to resize images. It includes a graphical user interface for making selections.

##History
January 11, 2015 (0.0.1) - Initial publish to Github repository.

#Use
Copy all of the files and folders into Photoshop's script folder. Or use the ExtendScript application to load main.js and run the script.

#Roadmap
The following features remain to be done.
~~- store user preferences~~
- output to new file: overwrite existing file
- output to new file: choose file type
- saving files progress
- pad image for output image with aspect ratio different from original (change canvas size)
- resize that's not proportional
- don't upsample images
- choose image types to include in folder source resize
- build (combine all JS files into a single JSX file)

and many more.

#Build
There's no build necessary. But in order to create a single file there will eventually be a 'build' process to place all o fthe files into a single file.

#License
Released under GPL3.
